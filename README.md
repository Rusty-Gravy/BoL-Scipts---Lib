# BoL-Scripts
Improved BoL Package, based on C3il's pack with updated Library and some useful scripts!

ALL .LUA FILES IN SCRIPTS/STORAGE OR SCRIPTS/COMMON ARE NOT OWNED BY ME, BUT THEIR RESPECTFUL OWNERS.
FILES CAN BE FOUND ON:  
http://www.scriptstatus.net/ OR http://forum.botoflegends.com/

Let's just cover some of the basics about the folders.

###Para's Instalocker
This utility will detect when you've accepted a match and will type a custom message in the chat such as "Premade bot!" or something like that, and then search for a champion of your choice to either pick it or instalock it. Generally before others can get to it. Very useful. Has a couple of spelling mistakes though, just type the name of your champion in the champion box and it will use that to find the champion through the champion select search bar.

###Scripts
#####Storage
This is where I've thrown all the .lua scripts that don't belong in common here. This is to help free users get around the limit of 5 scripts at a time, you can just move the scripts outside of the Storage folder and then BoL will detect it.
#####Common
Here is where you will find all the libraries and useful scripts that other scripts usually rely on. This includes prediction and libraries.

###Script Manager
You can use this to update all of the scripts at once. Extremely useful.
If a script doesn't update, you'll have to do it manually. Not all scripts are compabtible with Script Manager.

###Sprites
You know what these are.
Just sprites for the use of some scripts with visuals.

###x - bInj1
I haven't used this myself, but it seems to help users when their BoL client doesn't inject automatically or has errors.
If you have any problems, try running everything with this beside it.
